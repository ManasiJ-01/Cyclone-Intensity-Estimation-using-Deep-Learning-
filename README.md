# Cyclone-Intensity-Estimation-using-Deep-Learning-
A Deep Learning model takes cyclone images as input and estimate intensity of cyclone. A Convolutional Neural Network is build which accurately estimate the intensity of cyclone in less time. 
The accuracy of model is 94% which is good. This project consist of different optimizers like Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent etc to experiment to calculate losses like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error etc. For final evaluation, Adam optimizer and ReLu activation function is used.
